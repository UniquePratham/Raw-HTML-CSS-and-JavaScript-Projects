                <p class="sectionContent">Building your new home is exciting, especially when you understand
                    how the
                    process
                    works. Its understandable that buyers are excited to see their new home built from start to
                    finish.Our
                    homeowners enjoy watching the home come together, from pouring the foundation to framing and
                    watching
                    the home take shape.Once the home has drywall, they start to visualize themselves living in the
                    space
                    and how they will use it imagining what furniture goes where and how they will entertain friends and
                    family there.</p>

                <p class="sectionContent">We encourage our homebuyers to make an appointment with their agent or project
                    manager to come out and walk through the home at any stage,” Perschino says. “We suggest that it be
                    by appointment to cut down on some of the safety concerns or limitations when a house is under
                    construction. It also gives us a chance to offer a one-on-one conversation that may not be the same
                    via email.They spend a good bit of time designing the home to be unique to their family needs and
                    tastes so seeing it all come together is rewarding for them.</p>
